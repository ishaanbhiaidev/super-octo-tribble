      What the hack is working framework?? It is a set of habits which you will
      prepare for yourself which aligns with the identity you admire. It is the
      compilation of your habits which you are going to follow when you wake up
      till you sleep. Please look at some starter templates on this page, they
      will guide you;) We also understand everyone have their own routine, which
      might not fit in starter templates, hence we also have option where you
      can prepare your custom framework!
      <br />
      <br />
      Good luck! We hope you win your day with your working framework! üòéüèÜ
