      We would like to give a shoutout to Himesh Madan who launched this
      technique to set goals on his YouTube channel -
      <a
        className="text-black underline cursor-pointer"
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l3yC8ceyUY"
        target="_blank"
      >
        watch here
      </a>{" "}
      <br />
      <br />
      The idea is simple: set a goal, outline your actions, give it a title,
      choose a category, and estimate the time it‚Äôll take. But hold on, that‚Äôs
      just step one. Himesh Madan emphasizes a key point‚Äî"review often!" And it
      makes perfect sense. Without regular reviews, your goals and actions will
      just be data taking up space in our database. üòâ
      <br />
      <br />
      Good luck! We hope you achieve everything you aim for! üòéüèÜ
