      Start by tackling tasks that are both important and urgent. Set due dates
      for tasks that are important but not urgent. Try delegating unimportant
      but urgent tasks, and save unimportant, non-urgent tasks for last‚Äîor skip
      them altogether.

      Good luck! Let‚Äôs conquer that to-do list! üòéüèÜ
